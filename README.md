Key Features:

Interactive command-line interface for querying names.

Automatic gender inference using pattern recognition.

Career information retrieval with fallback to humorous default messages when data is missing.

Fuzzy matching for handling misspelled or similar names.

Clear, structured responses compatible with function-calling AI workflows.

Fully open-source under the MIT License for easy integration and customization.

Ideal For:

Developers looking to explore AI-assisted information retrieval.

Projects needing lightweight name and career inference tools.

Educational purposes for learning function-calling patterns with LLMs.
